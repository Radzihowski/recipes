4 medium-large potatoes
1/2 of onion optional
1 Tbsp of butter
2 Tbsp of Oil
1/2 tsp salt or to taste
1/4 tsp of pepper or to taste
Instructions
Peel potatoes and cut them into small wedges/fries, keeping them proportional for even cooking.
Rinse peeled potatoes in water, then lay them out on a cutting board and pat dry with paper towel.
Dice 1/2 of the onion. Melt 1 tbsp of butter in the frying pan and saute onion for around 3 min on medium-high heat, stirring frequently.
Next, add potatoes and 2 tbsp of oil, mix everything together. Cover and cook on medium high for around 4-5 min covered until golden. Use a dome-shaped lid for best results.
Reduce heat to medium and cook potatoes for approx. 15 min, stirring every 3-4 min.
Towards the end of cooking, sprinkle potatoes with salt and pepper.

Check for doneness by breaking one of the bigger potato slices. It's done when the potato breaks easily.
